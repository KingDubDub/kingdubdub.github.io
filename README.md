#Hello, welcome to my Github Pages site.

As you can see, I am poor and require free hosting from Microsoft, calculator programming doesn't make much money.

I made this game for a competition on Cemetech and got third place, which was exactly what I thought I was capable of so I'm pretty happy about that. The contest was to make a game with fire but there were rumors about it being cooking related so I had an idea for that first and sorta merged it with the fire concept and actually really improved the idea. [Here's the repo for the original submission](https://github.com/KingDubDub/Food-Fighter) and [my contest thread](https://www.cemetech.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=17457). It's honestly my favorite project since it was my first published original game, which I made after getting extremely burned out on Jetpack Joyride CE. I do plan on remaking it/expanding it at some point since I've had lots of cool ideas and I don't want them to be forgotten, plus I still need to fix the sprite pointer bug that I made a funny workaround for.

As I said earlier, I ported Jetpack Joyride for the TI-84 CE Plus calculator and people think it's cool for some reason. [Here's the releases](https://github.com/KingDubDub/Jetpack-Joyride-CE/releases) and if you want to see how it evolved [I made a thread on Cemetech on it.](https://www.cemetech.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=16948)
